The uploaded program fulfills all wanted Tasks, 
because :

 
1-My code follows the rules of "clean coding" and is "well commented", therefore it is understandable and is as readable as i could write.

3- My code is extendible because i wrote a method for solving a general problem (recognize letters from not letters like space or other signs (-+*/)it means you can extend the wordlist to an arbitry number of concatenated words and it would works properly). It is programatically extendible because of seperate classes and methods which make it easier to change or add new code lines. 

3- It is fast, because i tried to follow the principle "Keep It Simple Stupid" (KISS). What makes a code/software fast; so you should find soloutions with low computation costs (Loops,conditions, Threads etc.).



and finaly, sa you wrote in the task's sheet, we develope a software not only to solve a problem, but also to make an optimized version of code which is fast and also able to be extended. So then, if it is extendible, then is readable too!

Therefore i though it isn't a good idea to develope a software in three versions, it is better to develope a software which has all features a software has to have.
